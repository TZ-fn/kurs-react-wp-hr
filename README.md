# FavNote - App for saving notes

## Overview

This is a project of an note-saving app, based on [React w praktyce](https://eduweb.pl/programowanie-i-www/reactjs/react-w-praktyce/) (React in practice) course by Adam Roma≈Ñski.

The app has 3 main views: Notes, Twitters and Articles, all allowing to view and create new items. The app is connected to the MongoDB database, login details as well as all the notes are saved in the database.

Most of the code is based on the code used in the course, however login and logout functionality and some other small tweaks (e.g. counting items in the grid view, styling of the card items' shadows) I've made myself.
